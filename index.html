		<p>On Sunday, just around 3 pm, James Macklin,75, sat on the bench of Mosholu Park in the Bronx. Macklin was sharing a story with his friends about how he became addicted to cocaine and its detrimental effects on his life. </p>

			<p>Macklin says," I hate to tell you, my dear, but I lost everything to crack cocaine." Macklin became homeless because of his addiction. </p>
			
			<p>He continues to share his life story and speaks highly of the Bowery Mission, a well-known homeless shelter that told him he had to get clean to receive the help he needed. As a result, he became clean and is the Bowery Mission Director of Outreach for the homeless shelter, and he helps many homeless people and drug addicts who come to Bowery.</p>
			
			<p>Macklin's story is one in a million, but many New Yorkers still struggle with drug addiction, especially in low-income communities. </p>
			
			<p>According to the City, low-income communities like East Harlem are way more saturated with opioid clinics than in other parts of Manhattan. Statistically, low-income communities such as East Harlem have an average household income of $34,060 compared to high-income neighborhoods like Soho, whose average household income is $194,049, and Lenox Hill, whose average household income is $236,560. This should raise eyebrows to be a real problem in Manhattan. The graph below shows these statistics.</p>
